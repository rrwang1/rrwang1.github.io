Powerline radiation sensing &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The periodic electric and magnetic fields emitted by the service power cables distributed in civil infrastructures provide both time and location information. Our research exploits these fields to develop clock synchronization, natural timestamping, localization, and device authentication services for indoor and wearable IoT objects. &amp;lt;img style=&amp;quot;float: center;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;/posts/research/images/lora.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;image alt&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;512px&amp;quot; position=&amp;quot;center&amp;quot;&amp;gt; b.</description>

By 2025, it is estimated that there will be more than 41.6 billion networked IoT devices. These IoT devices generate 79.4 zettabyes data yearly, which is almost twice of today’s whole Internet (44 zettabytes). Transmitting such massive IoT data to the clouds for centralized processing will face communication bandwidth bottleneck.</description>

Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning in IoT As explained in our post, a hybrid computing paradigm consisting of edge computing at the front end and cloud computing at the back end will prevail along with the formation of IoT as a global infrastructure. In addition, the deep neural network-based learning and inference will be important for improving the sensing performance of IoT systems.</description>

Electric power distribution networks penetrate into all civil infrastructures. The service powerlines emit both electric fields and magnetic fields. The electric fields are induced by the voltages of the powerlines, and the magnetic fields are induced by the currents going through the powerlines. Because the power networks provide alternating currents at a nominal frequency (e.</description>

Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) form an important class of wireless networks for many geographically distributed Internet-of-Things (IoT) objects. LPWANs form a new pole in the spectrum of power consumption versus communication ranges, as shown in the figure below. LPWANs’ long-range communication capabilities will increase the degree of connectivity of IoT and enable deep penetration of networked intelligence into urban territories (e.</description>

      <description>Main contributors from the group: Duc Van Le (topic coordinator), Rongrong Wang, Yingbo Liu (alumnus)
We study the problems of sensing the environment conditions in a building and controlling various actuators to reduce the building’s energy consumption and maintain certain environmental condition levels when the load (e.g., IT equipment, human occupants) of the building varies over time. Dr. Rui Tan has early research works on residential power disaggregation by deploying wireless sensors in a nearly ad hoc way [1, 2], temperature field prediction [3] and cooling control [4] in computer rooms.</description>

The acoustic and imagery sensing modalities provide abundant information about the sensed target. As a result, the volume of an acoustic/imagery signal sample is often high and the data processing to extract useful information requires intensive computing. Such characteristics introduce various system challenges in data acquisition, computing, storage, and network transmission on networked sensing platforms with constrained processing capabilities, network bandwidth, and bounded energy supply.</description>

      <description>Our group has good interest and records in working with well motivated undergraduate students either from our own School and the external on research topics that we know. We guide them to read literature, perform hands-on work, and write the research report on a selected and timely topic, such that they can make their little but novel and publishable contributions. We believe that a senior undergraduate, if willing to undertake exploratory and challenging tasks, is ready for research.</description>
