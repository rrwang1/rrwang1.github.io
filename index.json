These IoT devices generate 79.4 zettabyes data yearly, which is almost twice of today’s whole Internet (44 zettabytes). Transmitting such massive IoT data to the clouds for centralized processing will face communication bandwidth bottleneck. In addition, the communication networks will introduce uncertain time delays that are undesirable for many applications. To cope with these grand challenges, edge computing moves the computation on the IoT data closer to the data sources. Specifically, the IoT sensors and the last-mile data aggregators, acting as edge nodes, will undertake a significant portion of the computation on the IoT data; only data summaries and commands will be exchanged between the edge nodes and the cloud servers through the Internet when needed. As such, a hybrid computing paradigm consisting of edge computing at the front end and cloud computing at the back end will prevail along with the formation of IoT as a global infrastructure.\nDeep neural network training and inference will be important forms of the computation at the edge. In particular, deep neural networks have good potential in bringing significant technological advancements for autonomous systems with a closed loop of sensing, decision, and actuation, among which the sensing step with high accuracy and high resilience is often thought most challenging. Recent research has provided various technical solutions to enable the training and inference at resource-constrained edge devices. However, the resilience (including security) aspect of edge AI has not been investigated adequately. The resilience studies in the general context of machine learning do not consider the specific constraints of edge AI, leading to difficulties in the edge AI deployment. The group is interested in studying the resilience issues of edge AI systems. As a preliminary study in this space, we have developed a moving target defense against adversarial example attacks on embedded visual sensing.\nDeepMTD Recent studies show that deep models (e.g., multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs formed by applying small but crafted perturbations to the clean examples in order to make the victim deep model yield wrong classification results. Systematic approaches have been developed to generate adversarial examples as long as the attackers acquire the deep model, where the attackers may know the internals of the model or not. Thus, adversarial examples present an immediate and real threat to deep visual sensing systems. Existing countermeasures are often designed to address certain adversarial examples and build their security on the attackers’ ignorance of the defense mechanisms. Thus, they do not address adaptive attackers.\nTraffic sign adversarial examples constructed by Carlini and Wagner’s approach. The two samples with red frames are clean examples; all other samples shown above will be misclassified by a deep neural network.\nBeyond the static defense, we consider a moving target defense (MTD) strategy. The figure below illustrates the workflow of our DeepMTD system. Specifically, it starts from a well-trained base model. When the system has spare computing resources, it adds independent perturbations to the parameters of the base model to generate multiple fork models. Each fork model is then used as the starting point of a retraining process. The retrained fork models are then commissioned for the visual sensing task. At run time, an input, which may be an adversarial example constructed based on the base model, is fed into each fork model. If the degree of inconsistency among the fork models’ outputs exceeds a predefined level, the input is detected as an adversarial example. The majority of the fork models’ outputs is yielded as the final result of the sensing task. If the system operates in the human-in-the-loop mode, the human will be requested to classify detected adversarial examples. We have implemented DeepMTD on edge computing platforms, NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, with techniques to reduce the computing overhead (e.g., serial fusion with an early stopping mechanism). The detailed description of DeepMTD and the evaluation results can be found in our paper published on ACM SenSys’19 (PDF).\nBibliography Our research [1] Moving Target Defense for Embedded Deep Visual Sensing against Adversarial Examples.

In addition, the deep neural network-based learning and inference will be important for improving the sensing performance of IoT systems. In a number of scenarios, the IoT edge and the cloud back end need to work together to implement AI-empowered sensing, during which privacy-sensitive data generated at the edge may be exchanged between the edge and the cloud. The group has ongoing research on designing and evaluating privacy-preserving learning and inference approaches in AIoT systems. Our challenge paper (PDF) provides a taxonomy of the existing privacy-preserving learning and inference approaches.\nPrivacy-preserving collaborative learning A collaborative learning system\nCollaborative learning builds a machine learning model (e.g., a supervised classifier) based on the training data contributed by many participants. It is a desirable and empowering paradigm for AIoT systems. By leveraging on the much increased volume of training data and coverage of data patterns, collaborative learning will approach the intelligence of a crowd and improve the learning performance beyond that achieved by any single participant alone. Moreover, a resource-rich learning coordinator (e.g., a cloud computing service) allows the execution of advanced, compute-intensive machine learning algorithms to capture deeper structures in the aggregated data, whereas the participants (e.g., IoT objects) are often resource-constrained and incompetent for intensive computation. By contributing training data, the individual participants will enjoy the improved machine intelligence in return. However, the data contributed by the participants may contain privacy-sensitive information that should be protected from the curious cloud.\nTop: original data samples. Middle: obfuscated data samples using Gaussian random projection. Bottom: Additively perturbed data samples for differential privacy (epsilon=10).\nFederated learning is a distributed machine learning scheme in which data remains at the individual participants and each participant will execute learning computation. However, the learning computation can be too heavyweight for resource-constrained devices such as embedded IoT sensors. Different from the federated learning, our work lets a participant device apply Gaussian random projection to obfuscate the data and then transmit to the cloud for training a deep neural network. The random projection introduces light computation overhead only and can be performed by mote-class IoT sensors. Every participant uses its own Gaussian matrix to prevent that the collusion between any participant and the curious cloud spoils the privacy protections for other participants. However, because of the participants’ independent projections, a pattern in the original data domain is split into N patterns in the obfuscated data domain (where N is the number of participants in the collaborative learning system). Our work systematically investigates the impact of the N on learning efficiency and also experimentally compares a number of baseline approaches on a hardware testbed, which include distributed machine learning, additive perturbation for differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption-based approach. The results are published on ACM/IEEE IoTDI’19 (PDF).\nPrivacy-preserving remote inference Resource-constrained edge devices may not be able to execute very deep neural networks. In addition, deep neural networks may be intellectual properties that should remain in the cloud. To address these issues, the remote inference (i.e., the edge device transmits the inference data to the cloud for inference computation and gets the result) can be applied. But the inference data may contain privacy-sensitive information. Our work develops a lightweight and unobtrusive approach to obfuscate the inference data at the edge devices. It is lightweight in that the edge device only needs to execute a small-scale neural network; it is unobtrusive in that the edge device does not need to indicate whether obfuscation is applied. We apply our approach to three case studies of free spoken digit recognition, handwritten digit recognition, and American sign language recognition. Results show that our approach effectively protects the confidentiality of the raw forms of the inference data while preserving the cloud’s inference accuracy. The results are published in IEEE IoT Journal (PDF).\nBibliography Our research [1] Challenges of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning in IoT.

The service powerlines emit both electric fields and magnetic fields. The electric fields are induced by the voltages of the powerlines, and the magnetic fields are induced by the currents going through the powerlines. Because the power networks provide alternating currents at a nominal frequency (e.g., 50Hz in Singapore), the electric and magnetic fields emitted from the service powerlines also oscillate at the nominal frequency.\nThe electric and magnetic fields from the powerlines can be easily captured by sensors. In our research, we use a resonant circuit to sense the oscillating magnetic field. Precisely measuring the potential in an electric field is technically difficult. However, if we only want to capture the periodic variation of the electric field, it is easy: we simply sample an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) placed in the electric field, and the measurement is the difference between the potentials at ADC\u0026rsquo;s input pin and ground pin. Connecting a conductor wire to the input pin will further amplify the ADC\u0026rsquo;s measurement, because the conductor wire increases the equivalent distance between the ADC\u0026rsquo;s input and ground pins in the electric field with gradients.\nTherefore, instrumenting IoT devices with the powerline electric and magnetic fields sensing capability is not difficult. In our research, we study how to exploit the powerline electric and magnetic fields that are pervasive in indoor spaces to address various challenges faced by indoor IoT applications.\nClock synchronization among wearable devices Tightly synchronizing wearable devices is useful for a range of applications such as analyzing body movement, delivering audio streams synchronously using two wireless earphones, etc. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) implementation is subject to delays from the operating systems and the media access control protocols. Normally, NTP over a wireless connection can achieve sub-second accuracy only. To achieve high synchronization accuracy, the synchronization program will need low-level access to the radio hardware. However, this is difficult given that the wearable platforms and wearable operating systems are becoming heterogeneous.\nWearables are generally equipped with ADC to interface with various sensors. We use the ADC to capture the electric potential on the wearer’s body, which is induced by the ambient electric field emitted from the indoor power networks. The human body can effectively amplify the electric potential, such that the ADC can sense it without needing any amplification circuit. We integrate the periodic electric potential signal with the principle of NTP to develop a new clock synchronization protocol for wearables. We can achieve a synchronization accuracy of a few milliseconds among the wearable devices on the same human body. Moreover, our protocol can be also used to synchronize the wearable devices on multiple users who are located at different places in the same power grid. This research was published on ACM SenSys 2017 (PDF) and IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (PDF).\nNatural timestamps in powerline electromagnetic radiation The power grid frequency is not exactly the nominal frequency. Instead, it fluctuates around the nominal frequency, depending on the instantaneous status regarding the balance between the power generation and consumption in the grid. In particular, the power grid frequency is almost identical everywhere in the grid. Prior work has shown that the power grid frequency fluctuation trace of a certain length in time forms a natural timestamp, because the fluctuation trace is unique over time.\nWe design two types of sensors to capture the minute power grid frequency fluctuations. As shown in the above figure, the sensors of the first type are plugged into the power outlets to directly capture the voltage and extract the voltage’s cycle length at microsecond granularity. The sensors of the second type (shown in the below figure) are based on a resonant circuit to capture the magnetic field from the powerlines and extract the power grid frequency fluctuation. Our experiments show that the natural timestamps captured by the two types of sensors achieve microseconds and sub-second accuacies across the Singapore island. Based on the natural timestamps, we develop a number of IoT system functions such as timestamp recovery and secure clock synchronization protocols. This research was published on IEEE RTSS’16 (PDF), ACM/IEEE IPSN’17 (best paper award) (PDF), and two papers on ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (PDF1, PDF2).\nThe clock synchronization based on the natural timestamps may have synchronization faults when there are localized disturbances in the power networks. We develop a network clock synchronization protocol to cross-check the peer-to-peer synchronization results and correct the faults. We analyzed the bounds of the fault correction capability and achieved a number of fundamental analytic results, applicable not only to our natural-timestamp-based systems, but also the general clock synchronization systems. This research was published on IEEE ICPADS’18 (PDF) and ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (accepted, in press).\nLocation sensing using powerline electromagnetic radiation Based on our work of wearables clock synchronization, we further inquire whether two wearables can perform same-body detection (i.e., the determination of whether they are on the same human body). We found that the electric potentials at two close locations on the same human body are similar, whereas those from different human bodies are distinct. Therefore, we achieved high same-body detection accuracy. This capability can be applied to develop a range of interesting system features for touchable IoT objects. For instance, in a home with multiple residents, when a user wearing his token turns on a TV set using a smart remote control, the control obtains the user identity from the token and instructs the TV set to list the user’s favorite channels. The user can also touch other smart objects to personalize them, e.g., touch a music player for the favorite music, switch on a light that automatically tunes to the user’s favorite color temperature or hue, etc. If the user can protect the personal wearable token well, the touch-to-access device authentication can also be used in more access-critical scenarios. For example, a touch on a smartphone or tablet unlocks the device’s screen automatically, allows in-app purchases, passes the parental controls, etc. Beyond the above use scenarios for improved convenience in access control, the touch-to-access scheme can also enhance the security of various systems. For instance, it can be used with fingerprint scanning to form a two-factor authentication against fake fingerprints. A wireless reader can access a worn medical sensor only if the reader has physical contact with the wearer’s skin. The contact enforces the wearer’s awareness regarding the access and prevents remote wireless attacks with stolen credentials. This research was published on ACM MobiCom’19 (PDF).\nThe team also collaborates with researchers at University of Oxford to study the use of the magnetic field emitted from the powerlines for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The results were published on ACM MobiCom’18 (PDF).\nBibliography Our research [1] Wearables Clock Synchronization Using Skin Electric Potentials. Zhenyu Yan, Rui Tan, Yang Li, Jun Huang.

LPWANs form a new pole in the spectrum of power consumption versus communication ranges, as shown in the figure below. LPWANs’ long-range communication capabilities will increase the degree of connectivity of IoT and enable deep penetration of networked intelligence into urban territories (e.g., wide areas, buildings, and underground structures) that have challenged the existing low-power short-range wireless technologies. Among various LPWAN technologies, we primarily focus on LoRaWAN due to its various advantages, such as the use of license-free industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band, open data link layer specification, and low cost (several US dollars per unit).\nOne-hop out-of-band control planes using LoRaWAN Many IoT networks will still be based on low-power multi-hop wireless networks. In the last decade, many wireless sensor networks are Zigbee-based multi-hop wireless networks. The recently announced Bluetooth 5 has added support of mesh network topology. However, from an engineering point-of-view, multi-hop wireless networks are often fragile and difficult to manage. To improve the network performance and manageability, some multi-hop wireless networks, especially those deployed for mission-critical tasks, have adopted centralized network controls. WirelessHART and ISA100.11a are examples. However, these networks still adopt in-band control planes, that is, the control-plane messages such as network status reports and routing schedules are delivered by the data-plane networks. The coupling between the control and data planes in the in-band scheme may lead to undesirable consequences. For example, when the data plane loses key routing nodes (e.g., due to node hardware/software fault and depletion of battery) or the control plane makes wrong control decisions (e.g., due to design defects or erroneous human operations), the data-plane network may fall apart to disconnected partitions. As a result, restorative network control commands in the control plane may not be able to reach the destination nodes.\nA number of recent IoT node platforms are equipped with both short-range radio and LPWAN. For example, the OpenMote B platform and the TI CC1350 integrate both Zigbee and sub-GHz LPWAN radios; the TI CC1352R provides both BLE and sub-GHz LPWAN radios. Therefore, we propose to build one-hop out-of-band control planes using LPWAN and we choose LoRaWAN as the LPWAN technology to prototype our system called LoRaCP. The one-hop control planes will not be subject to the feasibility and manageability issues faced by the multi-hop data-plane networks. In addition, as the control-plane network only deliver key network status information and control commands, the bandwidth provision of LPWAN can meet the traffic demand of control-plane networks.\nThe above figure shows our prototype LoRaCP end node and controller node, both providing Zigbee and LoRaWAN radios. We developed a software stack for LoRaCP to construct the control-plane network based on LoRaWAN radios. Our initial profiling experiments show that the TI CC1352R shown below (which is the CC1352R launchpad) can also support our approach of one-hop out-of-band control planes. The work of porting our software stack to CC1352R (the ported version can be called subG-CP) is in our plan.\nOn a testbed of 16 LoRaCP nodes, we apply LoRaCP to separate the control-plane network of the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) from its Zigbee-based data-plane network. LoRaCP brings substantial benefits such as increased frame delivery ratio in the presence of intensive Wi-Fi interference. This research was published on IEEE INFOCOM’18 (PDF) and ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (PDF).\nAttack-aware data timestamping in LoRaWAN LoRaWAN is promising for the applications of collecting low-rate data. Data samples need timestamps to make sense. In the traditional wireless sensor networks, the sensor nodes’ clocks are synchronized first, and then used to timestamp generated data. To tightly synchronize the sensor clocks, more network traffic for clock synchronization will be generated. This is bad for bandwidth-limited LoRaWAN. We showed that, since LoRaWAN follows a one-hop star network topology, the timestamping can be performed by the gateway upon the arrival of the data frame. This greatly saves the network bandwidth from the frequent clock synchronization.\nHowever, this gateway-side timestamping is vulnerable to a frame delay attack that can be launched in three steps as shown in the above figure: (1) frame collision and eavesdropping, (2) data transfer, and (3) delay injection and frame replay. We conducted experiments in a campus network, and showed that, by setting up two attack devices (collider and eavesdropper) as shown in the below figure, all LoRaWAN end devices in the yellow polygon with an estimated area of 50,000 square meters will be affected by the attack.\nVulnerable area of a campus LoRaWAN.

We develop a software stack, as shown in the right part of the figure below, consisting of various radio signal processing algorithms to detect the carrier frequency biases introduced by the replay steps of the frame delay attack. Overall, LoRaTS is a solution that strikes a satisfactory trade-off between network efficiency and the security level required by typical LoRaWAN applications in implementing data timestamping. This research was published on IEEE ICDCS’20 (PDF).\nIn-Hall Localization with Standard LoRaWAN Uplink Frames While LoRaWAN is mainly designed for establishing connectivity, being able to localize LoRaWAN devices unobtrusively using their uplink frames is desirable. The unobtrusiveness here means that no special software instrumentation is needed for the LoRaWAN end devices. As such, the localization service is free from entanglement with any other applications running on the LoRaWAN devices; the already deployed LoRaWANs can develop the localization capability seamlessly.\nWe design and evaluate a time difference of arrival (TDoA)-based, unobtrusive in-hall LoRaWAN localization (ILLOC) system for any off-the-shelf LoRaWAN end devices. ILLOC deploys multiple software-defined radio (SDR)-based anchors with known positions and estimates the position of an end device based on the anchors’ TDoA measurements regarding any single uplink frame from the end device. The design of ILLOC faces two challenges: (1) Narrowband: LoRa signals use narrow frequency bands, thus are long and smooth in time domain. Without special treatment, the uncertainty of arrival time estimation with 125 kHz bandwidth is up to 8 microseconds, which is translated to 2.4 km distance in ranging. (2) Inter-anchor clock skews: tight synchronization of the anchors’ clocks (ideally, to nanoseconds accuracy) is a basis of TDoA-based multilateration. However, implementing highly accurate clock synchronization via cabling can incur large deployment overhead.\nTo address these technical challenges, we propose the ILLOC system featuring two LoRaWAN-specific techniques: (1) the cross-correlation among the differential phase sequences (DPS) received by two anchors to estimate TDoA, exploiting LoRa\u0026rsquo;s CCS characteristic; and (2) the just-in-time (JIT) synchronization enabled by a specially deployed LoRaWAN end device providing time reference upon detecting a target device’s transmission, using LoRa’s Channel Activity Detection (CAD) feature. In a long tunnel corridor, a 70 × 32 sqm sports hall, and a 110 × 70 sqm indoor plaza with extensive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation paths, ILLOC achieves median localization errors of 6 m (with 2 anchors), 8.36 m (with 6 anchors), and 15.16 m (with 6 anchors and frame fusion), respectively. The achieved accuracy makes ILLOC useful for applications including zone-level asset tracking, misplacement detection, airport trolley management, and cybersecurity enforcement like detecting impersonation attacks launched by remote radios. This research was published on ACM IMWUT/UbiComp'22 (PDF).\nThe indoor plaza deployment (with extensive NLOS paths).

Dr. Rui Tan has early research works on residential power disaggregation by deploying wireless sensors in a nearly ad hoc way [1, 2], temperature field prediction [3] and cooling control [4] in computer rooms. At present, the group is actively conducting research for improving the energy efficiency of data centers in Singapore’s tropical condition with year-round high temperatures and high humidity levels.\nTropical data center proof-of-concept Singapore is a data center (DC) hub in Southeast Asia. However, Singapore’s year-round high temperatures and humidity levels introduce significant challenges for the local DC operators in improving the energy efficiency of their infrastructures. As Singapore’s DCs spend more energy in cooling, their average power usage effectiveness (PUE), which is 2.07, is higher than the global average of 1.7. In the United States, the DC sector accounted for 1.8% of the country’s total electricity consumption in 2014. In Singapore, this percentage is up to 7%. Thus, technologies that can improve DC energy efficiency in the tropics will further enhance Singapore’s attractiveness as a regional data center hub.\nAir-side free cooling that utilizes outside cold air to cool the IT equipment has been increasingly used to improve the energy efficiency of DCs [7]. However, air-side free cooling in the tropics has been long thought infeasible from the intuition that the high temperature and relative humidity (RH) of the air supplied to the servers will undermine their performance and reliability. On the other hand, the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has been working for years on expanding its suggested allowable temperature and RH ranges for IT equipment. For instance, the servers compliant with ASHRAE’s Class A3 can operate continuously and reliably when the temperature and RH of the supply air are up to 40°C and 90%. This sheds light on the possibility of air-side free-cooled DCs in Singapore, since the record temperature in Singapore is 37°C only and the ambient RH is in general lower than 90%.\nTo investigate the feasibility of air-side free cooling in Singapore, together with multiple partners in DC industry and research, we designed, constructed, and experimented with an air-side free-cooled DC testbed consisting of three server rooms located in two local DC operators’ premises. The banner image of this page illustrates the design of the testbed. It hosts 12 server racks with 60 kW total power rating. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the testbed. The results provide important insights and useful guidelines for the DC operators to implement and run air-side free-cooled DCs. A technical report [5] published by Nanyang Technological University fully describes the testbed design, experiments, results, and experiences.\nControl of tropical data center In the air-side free-cooled DC, the air-borne contaminants together with the moisture in the air will form corrosive materials to attack the IT hardware. To improve the reliability of the IT equipment in the air-side free-cooled DC under the tropical setting, it is beneficial to maintain high temperature of the air supplied to the servers, because high temperature will result in lower RH to reduce the formation of corrosive materials. To do so, a portion of the hot air generated by the servers can be recirculated and mixed with the fresh air from the ambient to form warm air supplied to the servers. This work applies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control the air blower speed and the ratio of the recirculated hot air such that the supply air temperature and RH are within specified ranges, and meanwhile the energy consumption of the air blower and the on-demand cooling is minimized.\nTo avoid thermal safety issues during the learning phase of the DRL agent, in this work we construct a computational model of the tropical data center (including a psychrometric model for temperature and RH, as well as a neural network for energy consumption) and uses it to perform the offline training of the DRL. Once the DRL training converges, it can be deployed to interact with the physical tropical data center. The below figure shows the workflow of our approach. The details of our approach and the evaluation results are presented on ACM BuildSys’19 (PDF).\nReal-Time Cooling Power Attribution for Co-located Data Center In co-located data centers, increasing the temperature setpoint of server rooms is a promising approach to reduce the cooling energy usage. As the tenants have different mentalities and technical constraints, it is desirable to support distinct temperature setpoints in the tenants’ server rooms. However, this will lead to the issue of inter-room heat transfers which will create biases in the rooms’ cooling power usages. Also, the existing cooling power attribution policies become inapplicable, since a fair attribution cannot be guaranteed. To support the distinct temperature setpoints, we propose a real-time cooling power attribution scheme based on a two-stage cooling system model that captures the essence of the cooling system designs in co-location DCs. For the first-stage cooling, we estimate the inter-room heat transfers to rectify the metered power usages of the rooms’ air handling units; for the second-stage cooling, we follow the Shapley value principle to fairly attributing the power usage of the shared cooling infrastructure to server rooms.\nCool power attribution for data center rooms with distinct temperatures supported by a two-stage cooling system (arrow represents heat flow).\nTo address the high computing overhead of the Shapley value, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) or a heuristic algorithm is adopted to approximate the Shapley power attribution function. Once the MLP is trained, a real-time execution can be performed. The heuristic algorithm can achieve the real-time execution without training, but with lower approximation accuracy. The details of our approach and the evaluation results are presented on ACM BuildSys’20.\nBibliography Our research [1] Supero: A Sensor System for Unsupervised Residential Power Usage Monitoring.

As a result, the volume of an acoustic/imagery signal sample is often high and the data processing to extract useful information requires intensive computing. Such characteristics introduce various system challenges in data acquisition, computing, storage, and network transmission on networked sensing platforms with constrained processing capabilities, network bandwidth, and bounded energy supply.\nDr. Rui Tan’s early research designed efficient systems for 1) networked seismic sensing that introduces similar challenges [^1][^2][^3] and 2) robotic fish’s visual sensing for monitoring aquatic debris [4] and harmful aquatic processes (e.g., oil spill and harmful algal blooms) [5]. The group is currently developing an acoustic echolocation system based on deep learning and networked imagery sensing for inspection tasks in manufacturing systems. This page briefly describes a completed preliminary work of using inaudible echos for room recognition.\nRoom recognition using inaudible echos Location awareness is increasingly needed by mobile applications. As of November 2017, 62% of the top 100 free Android Apps on Google Play require location services. While GPS can provide outdoor locations with satisfactory accuracy, determining indoor locations has been a hard problem. Our work designs a practical room-level localization approach for off-the-shelf smartphones using their built-in audio systems only. Room-level localization is desirable in a range of ubiquitous computing applications. For instance, in a hospital, knowing which room that a patient is in is important to responsive medical aid when the patient develops an emergent condition (e.g., falling in a faint). In a museum, knowing which exhibition chamber that a tourist is in can largely assist the automation of her multimedia guide that is often provided as a mobile App nowadays. In a smart building, the room-level localization of the residents can assist the automation of illumination and air conditioning to improve energy efficiency and occupant comfort.\nIn our approach, a smartphone uses its loudspeaker to transmit a 2-millisecond narrowband acoustic signal at a frequency (e.g., 20kHz) beyond human’s hearing limit and uses its microphone to capture the reverberation from the indoor environment (typically, a room) for 100 milliseconds. Based on the spectrogram of the 100-millisecond reverbnation, our approach can recognize the indoor environment via a machine learning algorithm. The short audio recording time (i.e., 100 milliseconds) helps preserve the user’s privacy. However, the environment’s response to such a short-term and band-limited acoustic excitation may contain limited information about the environment. To address this, we employ deep learning to train a convolutional neural network for the room recognition.\nWe conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results show 99.7%, 97.7%, 99%, and 89% accuracy in differentiating 22 and 50 residential/office rooms, 19 spots in a quiet museum, and 15 spots in a crowded museum, respectively. The below figures show several example room types and university tutorial rooms having similar appearance that are employed in our evaluation experiments, as well as the 19 and 15 spots in the two different museums that we experimented with. The results were published on ACM Ubicomp’18 (PDF).\nImagery sensing for manufacturing system Computer vision has become an essential component of the automated inspection processes in smart manufacturing systems. We design and implement an Edge-Fog Camera (EFCam) system that can adapt its configuration with deep reinforcement learning. EFCam leverages the off-the-shelf battery-powered wireless camera called ESP32-CAM at the edge and fog node (e.g., Raspberry Pi) to achieve cordless and energy-efficient operations in industrial systems. The wireless cameras can offer various benefits such as easy deployment, mobility support, and unobtrusiveness to the ongoing industrial processes. Additionally, wall-powered wireless fog node with sufficient computing resources is used to support the camera in facilitating deep learning (DL)-based image processing with short jitters and delays.\nIn our EFCam system, the wireless camera performs image pre-processing, and then transmits the data to a resourceful edge-fog node for advanced DL-based visual processing. The EFCam also applies the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to adapt the camera configuration to maintain the desired visual sensing performance with the minimum energy consumption under dynamic variations of industrial application requirement and wireless channel conditions at the factory. The detailed design of EFCam can be found in our IEEE SECON’21 paper(PDF) and its extended version in TMC(PDF).\nWe have applied EFCam to improve the quality control of the ink cartridge manufacturing lines at the factories of Hewlett-Packard (HP) Inc. Our target application is HP’s ink extraction testing (IET), the ﬁnal quality control procedure used to detect any defective batch in which the ink cartridges’ performance deviates from the speciﬁcation. The IET machine controls a stepper motor pump to extract ink from the cartridge and uses a liquid pressure sensor continuously measures the pressure in the tube. The measured pressure profile is assessed to determine the performance of the tested cartridge. However, formation of air bubbles with a sufﬁciently large volume can affect the liquid pressure measurement and cause many false alarms.\nTo reduce the recall rate in detecting the defective cartridges, we apply EFCam to monitor the air bubbles at the Y-joint of tube. The camera applies a two-step image processing pipeline. The first step runs the convolutional neural network to detect the presence of the air bubbles. The second step measures the volume of the detected air bubbles using a computer vision (CV)-based image processing framework. The details of this application can be found in our IEEE SECON’21 paper(PDF).\nRescuing speech recognition from microphone heterogeneity Run-time domain shifts from training-phase domains are common in sensing systems designed with deep learning. The shifts can be caused by sensor characteristic variations and/or discrepancies between the design-phase model and the actual model of the sensed physical process. In the cyber-physical sensing applications, both the monitored physical processes and the sensing apparatus are often governed by certain first principles. In this paper, we investigate the approach to exploit such first principles as a form of prior knowledge to reduce the demand on target-domain data for model transfer. We propose a new approach called physics-directed data augmentation (PhyAug). Specifically, we use a minimum amount of data collected from the target domain to estimate the parameters of the first principle governing the domain shift process and then use the parametric first principle to generate augmented target-domain training data. Finally, the augmented target-domain data samples are used to transfer or retrain the source-domain DNN.\nIn this paper, we apply PhyAug two acoustic sensing applications and quantify the performance gains compared with other transfer learning approaches. The first and the second case studies aim to adapt DNNs for keyword spotting (KWS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) respectively to individual deployed microphones. The domain shifts are mainly from microphone’s hardware characteristics. Our tests show that the microphone can lead to 15% to 35% absolute accuracy drops, depending on the microphone quality. Instead of collecting training data using the target microphone, PhyAug uses a smartphone to play a 5-second white noise and then estimates the frequency response curve of the microphone based on its received noise data. Then, using the estimated curve, the existing samples in the factory training dataset are transformed into new training data samples, which are used to transfer the DNN to the target domain of the microphone by a retraining process. Experiment results show that PhyAug recovers the microphone-induced accuracy loss by 53%-72% and 37%-70% in KWS and ASR, respectively. PhyAug also outperforms the existing approaches including FADA that is a domain adaptation approach based on adversarial learning and Mic2Mic and CDA that are designed specifically to address microphone heterogeneity. Note that KWS and ASR diﬀer significantly in DNN model depth and complexity. Specifically, we use DeepSpeech2 ASR model, it has 86.6 million weights, which is 175 times larger than the KWS CNN in terms of the weight amount.\nBibliography Our research [1] Quality-driven Volcanic Earthquake Detection using Wireless Sensor Networks.
